=============================================

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
---------------------
This is an UNOFFICIAL project with NO AFFILIATION or relationship with 
Zorin Ltd. or the Zorin OS development team. This showcase was created 
independently for informational purposes only.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Created a web-based gallery showcasing 42 software applications that come 
preinstalled with Zorin OS 18 Pro (but not Core). The webpage displays 
applications in expandable cards with logos, descriptions, screenshots, 
homepage links, and install commands.

WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED
---------------------

1. HTML STRUCTURE
   - Created index.html with embedded CSS and JavaScript
   - Implemented expandable card UI with smooth transitions
   - Added category filtering functionality
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

2. APPLICATION DATA
   - Added all 42 applications organized into 5 categories:
     * Creative & Design (10 apps)
     * Video & Audio (10 apps)
     * Productivity (9 apps)
     * Other Tools (8 apps)
     * System Tools (2 apps)
   - Each application has:
     * Title and tagline
     * Description paragraph
     * Homepage URL
     * Install command (apt or flatpak)

3. LOGOS
   - Created logos/ subdirectory
   - Downloaded logos for all 42 applications
   - Sources used:
     * Wikimedia Commons
     * GitHub/GitLab raw files
     * Official project websites
     * Flathub icons
   - Logos are stored locally as PNG or SVG files
   - All logo paths in HTML updated to use local files (logos/*)

4. SCREENSHOTS
   - Created screenshots/ subdirectory
   - CURRENT STATUS: Only Blender screenshot successfully downloaded
     * blender-1.jpg: 147KB JPEG (1280x720) - WORKING
   - Attempted sources (most failed):
     * Official project websites (many URLs 404 or return HTML)
     * Wikimedia Commons (access/redirect issues)
     * Flathub (URL structure unclear)
     * GitHub repositories (screenshots not in expected locations)

5. HTML UPDATES
   - All logo paths updated to use local files
   - Screenshot paths updated where available
   - Blender screenshot path configured correctly

KNOWN ISSUES / TODO
-------------------

1. SCREENSHOTS
   - Only 1 out of 42 applications has a working screenshot (Blender)
   - Many screenshot URLs are outdated or return HTML error pages
   - Need to find reliable sources for screenshots:
     * Check Flathub app pages directly for screenshot URLs
     * Search GitHub releases/assets for screenshots
     * Check official project documentation sites
     * Consider using Flathub API if available
     * Try alternative image hosting services

2. SCREENSHOT NAMING
   - Current pattern: <app-name>-1.png or <app-name>-1.jpg
   - Some apps might need multiple screenshots
   - Need to verify file extensions match actual file types

3. LOGO VERIFICATION
   - Some logos downloaded as 14-byte files (likely failed downloads)
   - Should verify all logos are valid image files
   - May need to retry failed logo downloads

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

- File: index.html (standalone HTML with embedded CSS/JS)
- Logos directory: logos/ (PNG and SVG files)
- Screenshots directory: screenshots/ (PNG and JPG files)
- No build process required - just open index.html in browser
- Uses vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS transitions for expand/collapse animations
- Clipboard API for copy-to-clipboard functionality

ATTEMPTED SCREENSHOT SOURCES
-----------------------------

1. Official Websites:
   - GIMP: www.gimp.org (URLs returned HTML)

   - Darktable: www.darktable.org (404 errors)
   - Krita: krita.org (no images found in HTML)
   - Inkscape: inkscape.org (URLs returned HTML)

2. Wikimedia Commons:
   - Tried direct file URLs
   - Tried Special:FilePath URLs
   - Most attempts returned HTML error pages

3. Flathub:

   - Tried CDN URLs
   - URL structure unclear, most returned 162-byte HTML files

4. GitHub:
   - Checked README files
   - Checked .github directories
   - Checked releases pages
   - Most didn't contain screenshot URLs

NEXT STEPS FOR HANDOFF
----------------------

1. Continue searching for screenshot sources:
   - Check Flathub app pages in browser to find actual screenshot URLs
   - Search GitHub/GitLab for screenshot files in repos
   - Check official project documentation
   - Try alternative image hosting services

2. Verify logo files:
   - Check file sizes (remove any 14-byte failed downloads)
   - Verify all logos are valid images
   - Retry any failed logo downloads

3. Update HTML:
   - Add screenshot paths as they're found
   - Ensure file extensions match actual file types
   - Test that all images load correctly

4. Testing:
   - Open index.html in browser
   - Verify all logos display
   - Verify screenshots display (when added)
   - Test expand/collapse functionality
   - Test category filtering
   - Test copy-to-clipboard for install commands
